I am a skilled mobile application developer with over two years of experience crafting robust and user-centric solutions. My expertise lies in Flutter and Dart, combined with Firebase for backend and database management. I have a proven track record of delivering high-quality mobile apps for clients while actively contributing to the developer community through platforms like Google Developers.

Beyond mobile development, I possess a strong foundation in Java and C++, along with experience in hardware development and robotics. This diverse skill set allows me to approach challenges from multiple angles, fostering innovative and comprehensive solutions.

As a committed lifelong learner, I am always eager to explore new technologies and expand my knowledge. My GitHub portfolio showcases a range of projects that demonstrate my technical abilities and problem-solving skills.
